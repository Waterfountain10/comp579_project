# PS: in the Rainbow paper, they didn't plot this as a standalone multi-step learning agent, but only used this "ingredient" inside the cumulative Rainbow algorithm
# I think it can still be interesting to isolate multistep learning as a standalone agent like this : DQN + N-step learning agent!!

# to do by max
